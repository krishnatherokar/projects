            Hey there! These are some of my web projects that I created during my Class X vacations (2021).

            <section class="card">
                <a href="sololearn.html"><button>Open</button></a>
                <section class="title1">Sololearn Clone</section>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is basically a clone of a code learning app "Sololearn".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Almost all the icons in that clone are functional. (It will respond when you click it)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It also has a chatbot that will respond to your messages. To access the chatbot, after you click 'next' 2 times, just click on message icon at top right corner and select any chat.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="card">
                <a href="tasks.html"><button>Open</button></a>
                <section class="title1">Todo List App</section>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is a simple todo list app based on browser localstorage. (stores data even when you refresh the website)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It will automatically delete the completed tasks the next day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I actually made it for my personal use and hence it contains a study section that was designed according to my study techinques at that time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
