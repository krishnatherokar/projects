# Projects

Hey there! These are some of my web projects that I created during my Class X vacations (2021). You can [visit homepage](https://krishnatherokar.github.io/projects/) or click on the project names to view.

## [Sololearn Clone](https://krishnatherokar.github.io/projects/sololearn.html)

> **Sololearn** is an app designed for learning to code, and it marked the starting point of my coding journey. This project is essentially a UI clone of the Sololearn app. I also included a chatbot, and here's a fun secret: The chatbot uses simple `if/else` conditions to function. (Well, everyone was a noob at some point ~_~)

### Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, jQuery

### Features
- Dynamic DOM generation
- Multiple modes (Dark, Light) and customizable themes
- Compressed static files for faster loading

### Issues
- Uses DOM manipulation to switch sections (profile, chat, code) instead of separate files and paths (Newbie mistake)

## [Tasks](https://krishnatherokar.github.io/projects/tasks.html)


> This is a **To-Do List** web app that uses the browser's local storage to save tasks. It will remember your entered tasks even when you refresh or close the window. However, if you clear the site-data in the settings, all the stored data will be erased.

### Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS

### Features
- Stores data locally in the browser (persists even after refresh)
- Automatically removes completed tasks the next day
