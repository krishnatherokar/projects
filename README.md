# projects
So hey there, these are just some of the web projects that I've created in my 10th class vacations (2021).<br><br>
The 1st one is **Sololearn Clone**: Sololearn is an app for learning to code and the starting point of my coding tbh. So it's basically clone of that app. A chatbot is also included there.<br><br>
The 2nd one is **Tasks**: It is an ToDo list web app based on browser cookies. It will remember your entered tasks even when you refresh or close the window. Once you clear the cookies in settings, all the data stored will be vanished.
